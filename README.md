Examples explain it best:

```rust
use filters::filter::Filter;

let not_eq_to_one   = |&a: &usize| { a != 1 };
let not_eq_to_two   = |&a: &usize| { a != 2 };
let not_eq_to_three = |&a: &usize| { a != 3 };

let a = not_eq_to_one.and(not_eq_to_two).and(not_eq_to_three);

assert_eq!(a.filter(&21), true);
```

For more examples have a look at the tests in `./src/filters.rs`.
